ammo_loader_enabled=Uncheck to disable the mod temporarily.
ammo_loader_draw_range=When enabled, draw range perimeter when hovering over chest. Disable if the game lags when selecting Loader Chests.
ammo_loader_debugging=Print debugging info to console
ammo_loader_performance_mode=Improve performance by storing more information in the global table. Will cause loading/saving to be slower.
ammo_loader_upgrade_ammo=When enabled, turrets filled with weaker ammo will attempt to return their items and upgrade when better ammo becomes available.
ammo_loader_fill_artillery=When enabled, Ammo Loader Chest will fill artillery turrets and wagons.
ammo_loader_fill_locomotives=When enabled, Fuel Loader Chest will fill locomotives with fuel.
ammo_loader_fill_burner_structures=When enabled, Fuel Loader Chest will also fill burner structures.
ammo_loader_bypass_research=Enable this to make Loader Chests available without research.
ammo_loader_max_items_per_inventory=Maximum number of items in each tracked inventory. If an inventory already has this number or more combined items in its inventory, it will be ignored. Use to limit how much Ammo Loader will use per inventory. 0 = infinte.
ammo_loader_ticks_between_cycles=Ticks to wait before each processing cycle. Raising this will improve performance at the cost of throughput. Requires loading savegame to take effect.
ammo_loader_max_inventories_per_cycle=Number of tracked inventories to process each cycle. Raising this will decrease the amount of time inventories take to get filled at the cost of UPS.
ammo_loader_max_items_per_slot=Maximum number of items in each slot of an inventory. Use this to limit how much ammo/fuel goes into turrets and vehicles. 0 = infinte.
ammo_loader_new_invs_checked_per_cycle=Number of new entities to check for new turret/vehicle inventories each tick. Lower this setting if the game seems to stutter when placing large blueprints.
ammo_loader_chest_radius=Maximum distance the chests will work from.\n\n[font=default-bold]0 = infinite[/font]
ammo_loader_max_chests_per_cycle=Number of chests to process each cycle.

ammo_loader_check_after_research=[font=default-bold]*WILL CAUSE LAG AFTER COMPLETING RESEARCH*[/font]\n\nPerform a full table check after completing research. Used for compatibility with mods that replace entities on research completion (i.e. Endgame Combat). Enable if the mod seems to stop working randomly.
# ammo_loader_return_items_to_chests=When enabled, items from tracked entities that the player mines (picks up) will be placed in nearby Loader Chests (if available) instead of going to the player's inventory. Prevents player's inventory from being filled when moving turrets or other entities.
ammo-loader-setting-use-cartridges=Loader chests require special ammo to operate. Requires extra time and resources.
ammo_loader_item_fill_size=Amount of items to insert at once when filling inventories. Note that entities will sometimes end up with more than this amount in their inventory (up to double), because the mod does not wait until an entity is completely empty before refilling it.
ammo_loader_provided_slots_per_tick=Number of script-reliant inventories to check per tick. Any entities that can move (car, train, character, etc.), as well as any entity whose Loader Chest is on a different surface (entities in factorissimo buildings, etc.) are script-reliant. Raising this number will cost more UPS, but will make these entities refill more rapidly. Increase only if you notice that some entities are taking too long to be reloaded.
ammo_loader_repair_tool_stack_size=Stack size of repair tool items. Useful to set maximum ammo for repair turrets. 0 = unchanged.
ammo_loader_slots_check_best_per_tick=This number changes how many turrets, etc. are checked per tick for new or better Ammo/Fuel provider. Increasing will make turrets recognize new loader chests and ammo faster, at a heavy cost to performance. Lower this setting if you are experiencing lag late game.\n\nWARNING-- INCREASING TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE HEAVY UPS LAG IN LARGE BASES
ammo_loader_highlight_selected_consumer=Highlight entities that are actively using Loader Chests when hovering over them
ammo_loader_ignore_logistic_turrets=Ignore turrets that have logistic interfaces from Logistic Turrets mod
ammo_loader_provide_all_surfaces=Enable to allow Loader Chests to provide to entities on other surfaces. Disable to make Loader Chests only provide to entities on same surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]May cause issues with Space Age when enabled, as ships and other planets may be provided as well.\n\nLoading entities on other surafaces has an increased UPS cost, as well as some delay when there are ~thousands+ of entities.[/font]

initial-dialogue-intro=Turn on the features you would like Ammo Loader to use.
initial-dialogue-artillery=Artillery
initial-dialogue-burner-structs=Burner Structures
info-ammo-loading=The first Ammo Loader+ research enables the use of the Loader Chest. Simply plop this chest down, fill it with ammo, and it will begin to automatically supply ammo turrets in range. Note that the chest requires a minimum amount of items before it will supply them to entities (10 for most ammo).\n\nThe chest will also supply the player character with ammo based on which guns they have equipped.
info-fuel-loading-1=The Loader Chest may be filled with fuel to supply fuel-using entities that are in range, just like it does for ammo. This functionality requires the Ammo Loader: Fuel research for fuel-using structures, and the Ammo Loader: Vehicles research for cars, tanks, trains, etc.\n
info-fuel-loading-2=This functionality must also be enabled in the per-map mod options (the Burner Structures and Locomotives checkboxes) in order to work. This is so players may disable this functionality if desired.
info-smart-loading=Loader Chests aren't just dumb inserters. They actively search for the best ammo and fuel available when supplying entities.\n\nFor instance, if a Loader Chest has both basic Firearm Magazines and Piercing Rounds Magazines available, it will use all available Piercing Rounds Magazines before supplying Firearm Magazines. Same for fuel -- Rocket Fuel will be supplied before Coal.\n\nThis also applies when multiple chests are in range of a single entity. A chest with only Coal will defer supply priveledges to a chest with Rocket Fuel if both are in range of the same car.
info-upgrading-1=After the Ammo Loader: Upgrade research is completed, Loader Chests will be able to upgrade ammo and fuel that has already been supplied to an entity. This is useful, for example, when you have a turret perimeter of 1000 turrets full of Firearm Magazines, and you'd like to upgrade them to Piercing Rounds Magazines without waiting for them to use up the rest of their ammo.\n\nThe Loader Chest will try to put the old ammo/fuel into the Loader Chest it came from if possible. Failing this, it will follow the Ammo/Fuel Return Rules (see below) until it finds somewhere to put the inferior ammo/fuel. If no place can be found, the Loader Chest will wait for some time before trying again. For this reason, it is wise to always have extra space available in Ammo Loader Storage Chests.\n
info-upgrading-2=This functionality must be enabled in the per-map mod settings (Upgrade ammo/fuel).
info-returning-1=Once the Ammo Loader: Return Items research is completed, Loader Chests and Loader Storage Chests will take extra ammo and fuel recieved when the player picks up an entity. This is useful for keeping the player's inventory clear of unwanted items.\n\nFor example, when the player picks up a car that has some fuel, the fuel is returned to any available Loader Chests in range before going to the player's inventory. The Loader Chest can then re-insert the fuel whenever the player places back down the car, eliminating the need for manual insertion of fuel altogether.\n
info-returning-2=This functionality must be enabled in the per-map mod settings (Return items on pickup).
info-main-1=Ammo Loader+ is a mod designed to make loading ammo turrets and fuel burning structures easier. For example, it allows you to expand turret perimeters or create ammo turret defended outposts without having to run a whole new belt line just for ammo.
info-chest-filters=Here you can set filters that will apply to all of your Loader Chests and tracked entities. \nFilters can also be applied to specific chests. To do so, Simply open a Loader Chest and use the Entity Filter GUI on the right side of the screen.
